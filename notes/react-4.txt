- show the component render/mahad
- how the count = count + 1; is not work:
  .because react dont rerender on local variabe changed thats why we use react js
- we cant update state outside of any condition/ because we already declear the inital 
- change object in useState ?
  .object that exist in state should be read only
- if we call multiple useState setter in function than what happend?
